# Hi there 👋
- 👋 Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Lawal Ayomide, a Machine learning and Artificial intelligence engineer 
# About me
- 👨‍💻 I am a sofware engineer with a strong background in Machine learning and Artificial intelligence. I've always had a keen interest in building AIs right from childhood, and since i came of age and got access to materials, I have been dedicated to learning, upgrading my skills and staying updated with the latest advancements in the field.
- 📚 I love reading books on programming, exploring new technologies, and enhancing my skills during my freetime. Continuous learning is essential to me, and I'm always excited about discovering new ways to improve my skills and knowledge. I also play the piano🎹
# Projects
This are some of the projects I have worked on:
- Project 1: Machine Learning algorithms
    - Description: Built the Linear Regression and KNN algorithms from scratch. 
    - Technologies Used: I used Numpy, pandas, matplotlib libraries and sklearn just to compare their accuracy to mine😁.
    - Key Achievements: Was able to see how they both work at the ground level and it deepend my knowledge of ML algorithms.

 

- Project 2: Data structures and algorithms school project
    - Description: Freelanced at my college by helping groups write their projects which involved implement stacks,queues, binary search and so on . 
    - Technologies Used: I wrote the code in C cos thats what the programming language we were instructed to use.
    - Key Achievements: This helped me to use the knowledge I had learnt from MITOpencourseware and CS50 on data structures and algorithms


Feel free to explore these projects and provide any feedback or suggestions. I appreciate collaborative opportunities and contributions from the community.
